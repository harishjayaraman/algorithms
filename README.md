# algorithms
Practice repository to learn Algorithms and data structure.

	. This repository will be a collection of algorithms and Data structures concepts implemented in Java.
	
	. Every algorithm and data structure concept will have a demo class and a Implementation class.
	
	.	Demo class will hold the main method and the input for the Algorithms.
	
	.	Implementation class will hold the actual implementation.
